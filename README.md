 # Title

 *Find Four*

 ## Description of Game 

In Find Four, players are not limited to starting only from the bottom row. They can place their pieces anywhere on the board, which means that they can create new connections and block their opponent's moves more easily. This variant of Connect Four requires players to consider not only their own moves but also their opponent's possible responses, which makes the game more challenging and strategic.

 ## How to Get Started

To start playing, Player One clicks on the slot they want to place their piece in. Once Player One is done, it's Player Two's turn to select a circle. The prompt under the game title indicates whose turn it is to play. This turn-based gameplay ensures that both players have an equal opportunity to strategize and compete for the win.
