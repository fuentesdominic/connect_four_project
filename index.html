    <p class="index-p">Find Four is a variant of Connect Four where players are not limited to starting only from the bottom row. Instead, they can place their pieces anywhere on the board. This twist adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as players must carefully consider their next move and explore more possibilities to win.</p>
